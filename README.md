Samura Tic Tac Toe

Description: 

Simple Tic Tac Toe game. Contains scoreboard that tracks player O, Player X and Ties. Built and modified from the bro code tutorial on youtube. Built with CSS, Javascript and HTML. CSS was used for style, HTML was used for the structure and organization of the game and JavaScript was used for the actual game function and keeping score. 

Problems:

I encountered some difficulty going back into the code to to create the scoreboard. Had to relearn some bits to make sure the modifications saved. 

Instructions:

(-No installation required.)

1. x starts first by clicking in one of the 9 cells. 
-(whoever goes first is x)
2. o goes 2nd always and an o will appear when it is clicked.
3. first to get three cells in a row or in a line wins.
4. the scoreboard tracks games until paged is refreshed.
